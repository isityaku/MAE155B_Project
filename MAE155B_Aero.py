### MAE155B Aerodynamics [WIP]
# Made By: Lance De La Cruz

## Outline
# State and justify airfoil choice
#   Include lift and drag polars for airfoil (XFLR5)
# Compute parameters for aircraft lift and drag coefficient equations
#   Refer to lecture for parameters required
# Define the following aerodynamic parameters (at cruise):
#   Lift Coefficient
#   Drag Coefficient
#   Lift-to-Drag Ratio
