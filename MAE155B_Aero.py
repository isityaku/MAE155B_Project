### MAE155B Aerodynamics [WIP]
# Made By: Lance De La Cruz

## Outline
# State and justify airfoil choice
#   Include lift and drag polars for airfoil (XFLR5)
# Compute parameters for aircraft lift and drag coefficient equations
#   Refer to lecture for parameters required
# Define the following aerodynamic parameters (at cruise):
#   Lift Coefficient
#   Drag Coefficient
#   Lift-to-Drag Ratio

## Atmospheric Parameters
g = 9.81 # gravitational acceleration [in m/s^2]
gamma = 1.4 # specific heat ratio
P = 101280 # atmospheric pressure [in Pa]
temp = 286; # atmospheric temperature [in K]
R = 287 # gas constant
mu = 1.8*10**-5 # dynamic viscosity
rho = P/(R*temp) # atmospheric density [in kg/m^3]
a = math.sqrt(gamma*R*temp) # speed of sound [in m/s]
L = 0.75 # estimated aircraft planform length (refer to MAE155B_Sizing_Scoring.py) [in m]

## Cruise Conditions
V_cruise = 18 # assumed cruise velocity [in m/s]
M = V_cruise/a # cruise mach number
Re = rho*V_cruise*L/mu # Reynold's number at cruise velocity

## Airfoil Configuration

Cl_min = [] # minimum 2-D lift coefficient
Cd_max = [] # maximum 2-D drag coefficient

## Aircraft Configuration (refer to MAE155B_Sizing_Scoring.py)
